# Field Calculator
A system for calculation of electric fields and particle motions within, complete with built-in analytic differentiator and arbitary function evaluator.


## content
This repository contains two parts: an (incomplete) analytical analyser, and a static Field extrapolator.

### analytical analyser
[...]

### static Field extrapolator
The primary focus of this project is simulating RF ion traps. For this only a static set of fields (AC and DC) are required.
